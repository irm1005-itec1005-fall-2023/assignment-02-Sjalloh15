<p>Open abayas and closed abayas can typically be the same thing depending on the design like for example you can have an open abaya with buttons that when buttoned up turn into a closed abaya, but there are also just closed abayas with no button or zipper and vice versa for open abayas meaning there is nothing to close them with.</p>
